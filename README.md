# Advent of Code 2020

These are my solutions for [Advent of Code 2020](https://adventofcode.com/2020).

## Log

### Preamble

I'm going to try doing these all with TDD. Unit tests first. Also, with Go. I don't have a lot of experience with it but it's fun to learn.

### [Day 1](https://adventofcode.com/2020/day/1)

I didn't realise each puzzle had two parts. That was pretty easy, the only challenge was figuring out how to iterate without needing the index from the range.

### [Day 2](https://adventofcode.com/2020/day/2)

Super easy, barely an inconvenience! It was fun to use a `struct` for the first time - I figured out that solution by Googling "how to do a tuple in go".

### [Day 3](https://adventofcode.com/2020/day/3)

Part 2 was way too easy - part 1 was a fun puzzle though.

I should probably build a file reader at some point.

### [Day 4](https://adventofcode.com/2020/day/4)

Today I decided to do "is it valid" first - then do the calculation as a separate test. I did this at lunchtime, and managed to get part 1 done no problem.

My work day is finished now and I'm not sure I have time - I have some house chores to do tonight and I am kinda beat from work. We'll see!
